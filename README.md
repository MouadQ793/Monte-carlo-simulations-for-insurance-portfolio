# Simulation-Techniques 

This project simulates the influence of weather dependency on motorcycle insurance claims. It employs Monte Carlo methods and Markov chains to model weather patterns and their impact on accidents and reimbursements.
The repository contains the final rapport in HTML/CSS, the final R/Script file and the assignement instructions in French.

I am currently preparing for my midterms that are scheduled on the second week of january so I put a hold on this project until I finish all my exams. By the the second/third week of February I will update this repo with an english rapport and english version of the assignement. 

Quick notes : the only reasons parallel computing wasn't used was because one of the main difficulties was that we weren't allowed to use any library at all.
Have fun reading :) !
